# Spectacles_Prediction_Project
In this project, we present an AI-based machine learning model designed to predict spectacles prescriptions based on a set of input parameters via a user-friendly app. Machine learning models are increasingly utilized in the medical field, and in this project, we apply three different algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to achieve the most accurate predictions from a dataset collected from young individuals. After evaluating the performance of all models, the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 96%, which was subsequently used for developing a web application to deliver the predictions efficiently. This approach showcases the potential of AI in enhancing healthcare services through predictive analytics.
